I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://research.snap.com/">Snap Research</a> on the <a href="https://research.snap.com/team/user-modeling-and-personalization.html">User Modeling and Personalization (UMaP)</a> team led by <a href="https://nshah.net/">Neil Shah</a>. My work focuses on advancing the state of the art in machine learning for large-scale recommendation systems, and I am currently interested in generative recommendation and representation learning utilizing multimodal user interaction data.

Broadly, I study how learning systems can make effective and responsible decisions in complex environments shaped by human, social, and economic factors.

Before joining Snap, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a> and I designed several components of TikTok's recommendation system. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jabernethy9/">Prof. Jacob Abernethy</a> and <a href="http://jamiemorgenstern.com/">Prof. Jamie Morgenstern</a>, where my research explored the theoretical foundations of learning systems informed by social and economic considerations, spanning topics such as mechanism design, differential privacy, robust machine learning, and active learning. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">IIT Kanpur</a>.
